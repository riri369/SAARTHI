## Civic-Issue-reporting-and-Resolution-System


## 📌 Background
Local governments often face challenges in promptly identifying, prioritizing, and resolving everyday civic issues like potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, or overflowing garbage bins. Although citizens encounter these issues daily, the absence of effective reporting and monitoring mechanisms limits timely municipal responsiveness.

This project aims to bridge that gap with a mobile-first, crowdsourced solution enabling direct community participation in civic management.


## 📝 Detailed Description
The system provides:

#### 1.Citizen Mobile App

Submit reports instantly with image/video evidence.

Automatic GPS tagging for accurate issue localization.

Short text or voice notes to add context.

Track submitted issues and receive stage-wise notifications (confirmation → acknowledgment → resolution).

Interactive Map & Dashboard

Live geographical issue visualization.

Highlighting of high-priority areas based on urgency or frequency of reports.

Status indicators for resolved vs pending issues.

#### 2.Administrative Portal

Centralized dashboard for municipalities.

Filters by category, location, and urgency for quick sorting.

Automated report routing to the relevant department (sanitation, roads, water, power, etc.).

Task assignment, updates, and citizen communication.

#### 3.Backend & Infrastructure

Resilient architecture with scalability to handle spikes in traffic.

Efficient multimedia upload and storage.

Real-time updates via API integrations.

Analytics & reporting: departmental efficiency, resolution timelines, issue trends.


## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
Empower citizens to play an active role in community management.

Speed up civic issue detection, prioritization, and resolution.

Improve government accountability through data-driven analytics.

Provide a scalable platform adaptable for various cities or regions across India.
